# ISS-Overhead
This program checks to see if the ISS is above you in the sky and it's dark outside then sends you an email telling you to look up.

The program runs infinitely, running the code once every 60 seconds to check the location of the ISS.

You will need to enter in your own email (to send emails) and your own longitude and latitude for the code to work.
You can find your own longitute and latitude at https://www.latlong.net/
